# CoursePlan

> CoursePlan is an iOS app that helps UCI students plan their course schedule for the year.

## About the App.
- Select the courses you have already taken, and the app tells you what courses you can take in the future.
- The application uses webscraping, written in JavaScript, to get the most up-to-date courses offered by UCI.
- I used a graph data structure to store the course data and used Kahn's algorithm to compute the right courses.
- The rest API has been coded using Node.JS with various libraries like Cheerio, Express, Request, graph-data-structure etc.
- Created the frontend in iOS using swift-3 and pods like Alamofire etc.
